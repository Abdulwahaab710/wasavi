Currently, wasavi is available for following browsers only. Select your browser and click the link. Standard extension installation procedure of your browser will follow. These extensions are hosted at the addons store of their respective browser.

* [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dgogifpkoilgiofhhhodbodcfgomelhe)

* [Opera addon](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/wasavi/)

* [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wasavi/)

Source code and latest development releases are hosted at [Github](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi):

* [Latest and unstable version of wasavi for Chrome](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/raw/master/dist/wasavi.crx)

* [Latest and unstable version of wasavi for Presto Opera](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/raw/master/dist/wasavi.oex)

* [Latest and unstable version of wasavi for Firefox](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/raw/master/dist/wasavi.xpi)

### A note for Opera users

Presto based Opera does not support DOM3 Composition Event therefore input via IME is not guaranteed. Presto based Opera does not allow extension to manipulate system clipboard, so the register `*` is unavailable on Opera.

### A note for Chrome users

Chrome has reserved some fundamental shortcuts, such as Ctrl+T, Ctrl+W. These keys cannot be used in wasavi.



Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

## How to launch wasavi

Focus TEXTAREA and press `Ctrl+Enter`.


## How to quit wasavi

To quit wasavi press `ZZ` or `:q` or `:wq` or any other VI quit command.

## How to use wasavi with Vimperator on Firefox

Put [wasavi_mediator.js](https://raw.github.com/akahuku/wasavi/master/src/mediators/vimperator/wasavi_mediator.js) in your Vimperator plugin directory, for example,  `~/.vimperator/plugin` or `%HOME%\vimperator\plugin`.

This plugin will control the pass-through mode of Vimperator according to the state of wasavi.

## How to use wasavi with Keysnail on Firefox

Put [wasavi_mediator.ks.js](https://raw.github.com/akahuku/wasavi/master/src/mediators/keysnail/wasavi_mediator.ks.js) in your Keysnail plugin directory.

This plugin will control suspend mode of Keysnail according to the state of wasavi.

## How to use wasavi as an independent text editor

Install wasavi extension and open the link to [wasavi online app](http://wasavi.appsweets.net/). wasavi will start automatically. You can use ex commands `:read`, `:write`, `:edit` or `:file` to access your Dropbox/Google Drive files. You will have to authorize wasavi via OAuth to access these storages.

## About automatic setting override

The `:set` commands which you input while wasavi is running are stored to extension's persistent storage, and those are regenerated when you launch wasavi next time.

This setting override mechanism works each independent URLs (max 30). If you think this is unnecessary, put `:set nooverride` in you exrc. Then overriding will be skipped.

## I Have noticed a bug

Please create an issue on [wasavi issue tracker](http://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/issues)

Tips and Tricks
===============

* to maximize the wasavi: `:set fullscreen` or `:set fs`
* to restore the wasavi: `:set nofullscreen` or `:set nofs`
* to change a color theme: `:set theme=blight` or `:set theme=charcoal`
* to modify initial settings:
  open preference wasavi extension (or enter `:options` on wasavi), and edit "exrc" textbox.
* abbreviate syntax is
	+ `:abbreviate` displays all the abbreviations currently registered.
	+ `:abbreviate [clear]` clears all the abbreviations.
	+ `:abbreviate lhs` displays the abbreviation corresponding to lhs.
	+ `:abbreviate lhs rhs` registers a abbreviation which
	  expands lhs to rhs.
* map syntax is
	+ `:map` displays all the mappings currently registered.
	+ `:map [clear]` clears all the mappings.
	+ `:map lhs rhs` registers a rule which translates lhs to rhs. Its translation is recursive.
	+ `:map [noremap] lhs rhs` also registers, but it is
	  non-recursive.
	+ `:map` targets the normal mode mappings. On the other hand,
	  `:map!` targets the insert mode. This is equivalent to vim's `:imap`.
* j k ^ $ moves cursor by physical row, on the other hand,
  gj gk g^ g$ moves by wrapped row. To swap the behavior: `:set jkdenotative`
* f/F/t/T extension for Japanese: these commands recognizes reading (ro-ma ji
  expression) of hiragana, katakana, and kanji. For example, `fk` will place
  a cursor on 'æ¼¢'.
* use a online storage as file system:
	+ `:filesystem status` shows all file systems currently available.
	+ `:filesystem default` shows default file system. You can set default file system
	  via `:filesystem default dropbox` or `:filesystem default gdrive`.
	+ `:filesystem reset` discards the access token for online storage.
	+ You can place the file system name at the head of a file name explicitly:
	  for instance, `:read dropbox:/hello.txt`.
* When you read from the register of A to Z, some registers returns special content:
	+ `B` register: user agent string
	+ `D` register: current date time string (formatted by using `datetime` option as template of strftime(3))
	+ `T` register: title string
	+ `U` register: URL string
	+ `W` register: version string of wasavi
* To return a setting to default state:
	+ `:set <option-name>&` or `:set <option-name>&default`
* To return all settings to default state:
	+ `:set all&` or `:set all&default`
* To return a setting to the state just after evaluation of exrc:
	+ `:set <option-name>&exrc`
* To return all settings to the state just after evaluation of exrc:
	+ `:set all&exrc`
